    "description": "Iran is assessing the damage and lashing out over the American and Israeli airstrikes on its nuclear sites, though Tehran kept open the possibility Tuesday of resuming talks with Washington over its atomic program.  The comments by government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani also included another acknowledgment that Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz — key sites within Iran’s nuclear program — had been “seriously damaged” by the American strikes.  Iran's state-run IRNA news agency quoted Mohajerani as making the remarks at a briefing for journalists.",

Western sanctions aimed at cutting Russia's oil revenues following its invasion of Ukraine have led to the rise of a vast \"shadow fleet\" of tankers that helps Moscow to keep its crude exports flowing.  From Tuesday German authorities have begun questioning passing tankers about their insurance coverage against oil pollution damage, the foreign ministry said, adding that the insurance coverage of \"shadow fleet\" vessels is often unknown, as they avoid reputable insurers and European ports.",
