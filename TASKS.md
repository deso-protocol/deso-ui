## Phase 1: News Scraping Infrastructure (âœ… COMPLETED)

### 1.1 Backend News Scraping Service
**Technology:** âœ… **Node.js** with `rss-parser` and `cheerio` for OG data extraction.

**News Sources Implemented:**
- âœ… **General/World**: Google News, NY Times, Washington Post, Yahoo News, BBC
- âœ… **Business**: CNBC, BBC
- âœ… **Tech**: BBC
- âœ… **Sports**: ESPN, Yahoo Sports, Sky News, BBC, Reddit Sports

**Key Features Implemented:**
- âœ… **Smart OG Data Extraction**: Fetches `og:image` and `og:description` for high-quality content.
- âœ… **Intelligent Deduplication**: Uses Levenshtein distance to detect and merge similar articles, removing duplicates.
- âœ… **Scalable Architecture**: Sources are managed in a simple array, making it easy to add/remove feeds.

### 1.2 Database Schema
**Technology:** âœ… JSON files in `/data` directory.

### 1.3 Next.js API Routes
**Location:** `src/app/api/news/`
- âœ… `GET /api/news` - Fetches all news, filterable by category.
- âœ… `GET /api/news/[category]` - Fetches news for a specific category.
- âœ… `GET /api/news/trending` - Fetches trending news.

---

## Phase 2: Frontend News Display

### 2.1 News Components (âœ… COMPLETED)
- âœ… `@media-card.tsx`: Adapted for displaying news items.
- âœ… `@tabs.tsx`: Used for category navigation.
- âœ… `@timestamp.tsx`, `@copy-button.tsx`, etc. are integrated.
- âœ… `NewsCard`, `NewsFeed`, `CategoryTabs` custom components created and functional.

### 2.2 Page Structure (âœ… COMPLETED)
- âœ… `src/app/page.tsx`: Homepage displays the news feed.

### 2.3 Data Fetching Strategy (âœ… COMPLETED)
- âœ… `useNews` hook with React Query fetches data from the API.
- âœ… Caching, loading, and error states are handled.

### 2.4 User-Configurable Feeds (ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS)
**Goal:** Allow users to select which news sources they want to see in their feed via a dropdown checklist. Preferences will be saved to local storage.

**Components to Create:**
```typescript
// src/components/news/feed-selector.tsx
interface FeedSelectorProps {
  sources: SourcePreference[];
  onPreferencesChange: (updatedSources: SourcePreference[]) => void;
}

interface SourcePreference {
  name: string;
  url: string; // Used as a unique ID
  isEnabled: boolean;
}
```

**Hooks to Create:**
```typescript
// src/hooks/useFeedPreferences.ts
export function useFeedPreferences() {
  // - Load preferences from localStorage on mount.
  // - Provide a function to update preferences.
  // - Return the list of all sources with their enabled/disabled state.
}
```

**API Modification:**
- The `scrape-news.js` script will need to be updated to dynamically scrape feeds based on user selection, or the API will need to filter based on enabled sources. For now, we will filter on the client-side after fetching all data.

**UI Integration:**
- Add a "Filter Sources" button to the header or near the category tabs.
- This button will open the `FeedSelector` dropdown/popover.

## Phase 3: DeSo Integration (FUTURE)

### 3.1 DeSo Authentication Setup
**Leverage blockheights patterns.**

### 3.2 Post Creation Integration
- Implement `NewsPostCreator` component and `useNewsPost` hook.
- Wire up the "DISCUSS" button to open the post creator.

# DeSo News - Real News Data Management

## ðŸŽ‰ Real News Integration Complete!

Your DeSo News app is now displaying **real, live news content** instead of mock data! The app fetches headlines from BBC and CNN RSS feeds across multiple categories.

## Current News Data Status

- **Total Articles**: 86 real news items (5 duplicates automatically removed)
- **News Sources**: BBC, CNN (Reuters had connectivity issues)
- **Categories**: General (20), Tech (20), Sports (20), World (18), Business (8)
- **Deduplication**: Smart duplicate detection prevents same stories from appearing multiple times
- **Last Updated**: Check your `data/metadata.json` file
- **Data Location**: `/deso-news/data/` directory

## Managing News Data

### View Current Data
```bash
# Check data directory contents
ls -la data/

# View metadata and stats
cat data/metadata.json

# View specific category (e.g., tech news)
cat data/tech.json | head -50
```

### Refresh News Data
```bash
# Manual refresh (fetches latest news)
npm run scrape

# Alternative command
npm run refresh-news
```

### API Endpoints for Real Data
- `http://localhost:3001/api/news` - All news (latest 20 by default)
- `http://localhost:3001/api/news/tech` - Tech news only  
- `http://localhost:3001/api/news/sports` - Sports news only
- `http://localhost:3001/api/news?trending=true` - Trending items

### Sample Real Headlines Currently Live
- "Microsoft to cut up to 9,000 jobs as it invests in AI"
- "Trump pleads not guilty to 34 felony counts" 
- "Tesla deliveries fall for second quarter in a row"
- "Four charged over break-in at RAF Brize Norton"
- "Global Climate Summit Reaches Historic Agreement"

## Technical Details

### News Scraper
- **Technology**: Node.js with RSS Parser (instead of Python due to environment issues)
- **Sources**: BBC RSS feeds, CNN RSS feeds
- **Frequency**: Manual (run `npm run scrape` to update)
- **Data Format**: JSON files stored in `/data/` directory

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface NewsItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  url: string; // Real BBC/CNN URLs
  imageUrl: string; // Real images from news sources
  category: string; // tech, sports, world, business, general
  source: string; // bbc, cnn
  publishedAt: string;
  scrapedAt: string;
  trending: boolean;
  viewCount: number;
  discussionCount: number;
}
```

### Deduplication Features âœ…
- **URL-based deduplication**: Identical article URLs are automatically detected
- **Title similarity detection**: Articles with 85%+ similar titles are merged
- **Category prioritization**: Tech/Business/Sports articles preferred over General
- **Smart merging**: Best image, description, and metadata are preserved
- **Transparent logging**: Console shows which duplicates were removed

### Future Enhancements
1. **Automated Refresh**: Set up cron job to run scraper every 12 hours
2. **More Sources**: Add Reuters, AP, other news outlets when connectivity improves
3. **Image Processing**: Better image extraction and fallbacks
4. ~~**Content Filtering**: Remove duplicate stories across sources~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
5. **Trending Algorithm**: Smart ranking based on recency and engagement

## Troubleshooting

### No News Data Showing?
1. Check if data files exist: `ls data/`
2. Refresh data: `npm run scrape`
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Check API directly: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/news`

### Scraper Issues?
- Check network connection
- Some RSS feeds may be temporarily unavailable
- The scraper gracefully handles failures and continues with available sources

### Want to Add More News Sources?
Edit `scripts/scrape-news.js` and add new RSS feeds to the `RSS_SOURCES` object.

### Phase 6: Wallet Balance Display (âœ… COMPLETED)

- [x] **GraphQL Queries**:
    - [x] Add `GET_USER_BALANCE` query and `ACCOUNT_BALANCE_FRAGMENT` to `lib/graphql/queries.ts`.

- [x] **API Route for Exchange Rate**:
    - [x] Create an API route at `app/api/exchange-rate/route.ts` to proxy requests to the DeSo exchange rate API and avoid CORS issues.

- [x] **Create Hooks**:
    - [x] Create `hooks/useUserBalance.ts` to fetch the balance for a given public key using the new GraphQL query.
    - [x] Create `hooks/useExchangeRate.ts` to fetch the DeSo-to-USD exchange rate from the new API route.
    - [x] Create `hooks/useBalanceDisplay.ts` as a composite hook to orchestrate the balance and exchange rate hooks, providing formatted strings for the UI.

- [x] **Create `BalanceDisplay` Component**:

---
### Phase 7: News Discussion & Post Creation (Planned)

This feature will allow users to create DeSo posts about a specific news article, linking the on-chain content to the source article via a post association.

- [x] **Create Page Route & Logic**:
    - [x] Create a new page at `deso-news/src/app/create/page.tsx`.
    - [x] This page will use `useSearchParams` to read the news article's URL and title.
    - [x] It will display the context of the news item being discussed.

- [x] **Update `NewsCard` Component**:
    - [x] Modify the `onDiscuss` handler in `deso-news/src/components/news/news-card.tsx`.
    - [x] The handler will use Next.js's `router.push` to navigate to `/create` and pass the `url` and `title` of the news item as query parameters.

- [x] **Implement `/create` Page UI**:
    - [x] The page will show the news item context (title, source, etc.).
    - [x] It will feature the `Editor` component, configured with `useMarkdownEditor={true}`.
    - [x] The editor's textarea will be pre-populated with a link to the news article.
    - [x] The editor will only be rendered if the user is logged in.

- [x] **Define Association Schema & Constants**:
    - [x] Add a new constant `NEWS_ASSOCIATION_APP_PUBLIC_KEY` to `deso-news/src/lib/constants.ts` and set its value to `BC1YLjSGY3DETtVTsiDVkobtvfDDtMuTjFoG1rmSagtWPzHyEZ3BKuB`.
    - [x] The association schema will be:
        - `AssociationType`: `'NEWS_ITEM'`
        - `AssociationValue`: The URL of the news article.

- [x] **Implement Post Submission Logic**:
    - [x] Create a new hook, `useCreateDiscussionPost.ts`, to handle the submission flow.
    - [x] This hook will perform a two-step transaction:
        1.  **Submit Post**: First, submit the content from the editor as a standard DeSo post. The news article URL will also be included in the `PostExtraData`.
        2.  **Create Association**: Once the post is successfully created, use the returned `PostHashHex` to create and submit a `post-association` transaction with the defined schema.
    - [x] This hook will manage all loading and error states, providing feedback to the user via toasts.

- [x] **API & Library Integration**:
    - [x] Add a new function to `deso-news/src/lib/deso/api.ts` called `createPostAssociation` that wraps the call to the `/api/v0/post-associations/create` endpoint.
    - [x] The `useCreateDiscussionPost` hook will use this new API function.

## ðŸ’¡ Gotchas & Coding Patterns

This section documents key learnings and solutions discovered during development.

### 1. `deso-protocol` Library Usage
- **Finding:** The `deso-protocol` library does not export a `Deso` class for bundling all functions. Instead, it exports individual functions directly (e.g., `submitPost`, `createPostAssociation`).
- **Pattern:** Always import functions directly from `deso-protocol`.
  ```typescript
  import { submitPost, createPostAssociation } from 'deso-protocol';
  ```
- **Gotcha:** Attempting to import a `Deso` class will result in a compilation error: `Attempted import error: 'Deso' is not exported from 'deso-protocol'`.

### 2. Handling `deso-protocol` Response Objects
- **Finding:** Functions like `submitPost` return a complex object containing both the *constructed* transaction and the *submitted* transaction response. The confirmed, on-chain data is in the `submittedTransactionResponse`.
- **Pattern:** When you need the final `PostHashHex` after a submission, access it from `response.submittedTransactionResponse.PostEntryResponse.PostHashHex`.
- **Gotcha:** Accessing `response.constructedTransactionResponse` will give you the transaction details *before* it was signed and submitted, which may not contain the final post hash or confirmation data. Relying on it can lead to errors where the hash appears to be missing.

### 3. Type Safety with `deso-protocol`
- **Finding:** The library does not export all of its internal TypeScript types, such as `ConstructedAndSubmittedTx`.
- **Pattern:** When a needed type is not exported, use `any` as a temporary escape hatch to avoid blocking development. Then, use `console.log` to inspect the real object structure at runtime and access the needed properties.
  ```typescript
  // In useCreateDiscussionPost.ts
  const postResponse: any = await submitPost(...);
  const postHashHex = postResponse.submittedTransactionResponse?.PostEntryResponse?.PostHashHex;
  ```
- **Gotcha:** Directly trying to import un-exported types will cause TypeScript errors. While using `any` is not ideal, it's a practical workaround for this specific library limitation.

### 4. Client-Side Navigation in Next.js App Router
- **Finding:** Passing event handlers as props from a parent component can sometimes unintentionally override the intended navigation logic in a child component.
- **Pattern:** For simple navigation, it's often cleaner to let the child component handle its own routing using the `useRouter` hook from `next/navigation`. This keeps the component self-contained and avoids unexpected behavior.
- **Gotcha:** In our case, the `NewsFeed` component had an `onDiscuss` handler that just logged to the console, preventing the `NewsCard`'s own navigation logic from ever running. Removing the prop from the parent fixed the issue instantly.
