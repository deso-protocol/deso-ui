**How to Install**

DeSo UI is built with [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and can be installed with the ShadCN CLI and registry using the `shadcn@latest add` command.

Components will be added to `/components/deso-ui` in your project.

```bash

```

You can install individual shadcn components with the `shadcn@latest add` command.

npx shadcn@latest add button
```

If you want to install all shadcn components, you can run this command:
